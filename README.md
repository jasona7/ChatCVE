# üåê ChatCVE Langchain App 

## üéØ Description
The ChatCVE Lang Chain App is an AI-powered DevSecOps application üîç, to help organizations triage and aggregate CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) information. By leveraging state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing, ChatCVE makes detailed Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) data available to everyone, because Security is everyone's job.  From Security analysts to Audit and Compliance teams, ChatCVE allows a more intuitive and engaging way to extract key findings. ü§ñüí¨

## üöÄ Features
- **üß† Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions using plain English (or your preferred language)! No need to grapple with complex query languages. 
- **üîÆ AI-Powered Analysis**: Our app is backed by Langchain's AI framework.  It can easily surface important vulnerability information using Human Language.  The requests are translated to SQL for querying specific artifact findings.
- **‚è≠Ô∏è Proactive Assistance**: Anyone can identify potential concerns proactively to improve the overall Cyber Security Posture.
- **üîÅ Triage & Remediation**: Assist in Vulnerability remediation using the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).  Can be extended to triage using other CVE advisory databases.

## üíª Usage
1. Initiate a scan that will kick off the SBOM and CVE artifact creation:
``` bash
python scan.py
```

2. Initiate an App Patrol scan which will create SBOM records in the SQLite3 backend:
``` bash
python fetch_daily_nvd_cves.py
```

3. Check the SBOM records have been added:
``` bash
sqlite3 app_patrol.db
sqlite> SELECT * FROM app_patrol LIMIT 10;

4. Start the Chat-CVE session:
```bash
python chat_cve.py
```

5. Query at the prompt:
```bash
Enter a question or type 'exit' to quit: Which NAME in app_patrol table has the most CRITICAL Severity records?
```
    Expected Output:
```bash
** Thought: I should query the app_patrol table to get the name with the most Critical CVEs. **
Thought: I should execute the query to get the results.
Action: query_sql_db
Action Input: SELECT NAME, COUNT(*) AS Top FROM app_patrol WHERE SEVERITY = 'Critical' GROUP BY NAME ORDER BY Top DESC LIMIT 3
Observation: [('curl', 42), ('libcurl4', 42), ('libpcre2-8-0', 16)]
Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: The top 3 Names in the app_patrol table sorted by the top count of critical in the severity column are 'curl', 'libcurl4', and 'libpcre2-8-0'.
```


## üåà Software Supply Chain and Security Use Cases
- **Security Analysts**: Assist Triage & find detailed CVE information quickly without dealing with intricate databases.
- **Audit Teams**: Efficiently target auditing efforts and ensure compliance with security standards.
- **Compliance Teams**: Maintain documentation and track usage for attestation efforts, ensuring all known libraries are documented.  Non technical personnel can simply use human langauge.
- **Development Teams**: Efficiently target underlying libraries and get access to remediation suggestions.
